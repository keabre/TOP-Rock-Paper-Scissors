# TOP-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a simple game project, the idea provided and guided through by way of progressing through 'The Odin Project'.

The purpose of this project is to get familiar with building a JavaScript project from scratch.

An additional purpose of this project is to practice the understanding, planning and writing pseudocode process, along with other programming techniques surrounding the topic of problem solving when programming (including "divide and conquer" and debugging) which were lessons provided by The Odin Project that are meant to be coupled with this project and all others going forward.

This project is not an original idea but rather to be a vice to display my foundational understanding of concepts to be used during the production phase i will carry out.
